## Sample Admission to Labor and Delivery Note
**CC:**  Contractions, ROM?

**HPI:**  (include age, gravidity, parity, estimated gestational age, and reason for admission

*ex 26yo G3P1A1 @ 38W5D EGA presents with painful contractions since noon.) Pt reports good fetal movement, and denies rupture of membranes or vaginal bleeding.*  Estimated date of confinement (EDC) by 1st/2nd/3rd trimester US vs LMP.

**Pertinent OB HPI:**  Includes Prenatal Care (PNC), Labs (HIV, GBS, rubella, H/H, etc), most recent U/S and any abnormalities, ?GDM/HTN, wt gain, size=dates.

**OB history:**  List each pregnancy, outcome, date, and complications (see eCW)

**Gyn history:** H/o abnormal PAP, LEEP, etc?

PMH, PSH, Meds, Allergies, Social history (is FOB involved, +/- tbc/etoh/drug use, where are they living, do they have social support?)

**Focused Physical exam:**

 - General and Vital signs
 - ENT – hydration status?
 - Lungs
 - CV – murmur?
 - Abd – Gravid, fundus non-tender (NT), fundal height (FH) 38cm, Leopold maneuvers:  Fetus is vertex (VTX), estimated fetal weight (EFW) 3300 gm.
 - GU - Sterile speculum examination if indicated to rule out SROM, SVE = 4cm/80%/VTX/ –1
 - Ext – edema? Swelling/pain/Homan’s sign?
 - Neuro – reflexes
 - Pertinent Labs – Always get a CBC on admission, usually T&S, GBS if not previously done
 - Tracings:  FHT – Category I/II/III (Baseline, accelerations, decelerations, variability), Toco (ctx q 4-5 min)

**A/P:** *26yo G3P1 at 39 wks gestation by 1st trimester US here in labor*

1.	_IUP (Intrauterine pregnancy): fetal heart tracing (FHT) reassuring, verification of vertex positioning by bedside ultrasound **(be sure to print out screen showing position)**_
2.	*GBS status*
3.	*Membrane status (SROM at 0600 vs membranes intact vs AROM at 1500)*
4.	*Pain control plan*
5.	*Any pertinent labs/history/etc*
6.	*Anticipate NSVD*

## Sample Labor Note (Q2H)

## Sample Delivery Note #1
 NSVD of a live male, 3000 gm and Apgars 9/9. Delivered LOA over intact perineum with/out epidural anesthesia @ 13:00.  No nuchal cord, light meconium.  Body delivered without difficulty. Infant was vigorous with spontaneous respiratory efforts. Mouth and nose were suctioned. Cord clamped and cut after 1 minute.  Infant placed on maternal abdomen. Placenta delivered spontaneously, appears intact with 3 vessel cord. Fundus firm, minimal bleeding. Perineum and vagina inspected – small 2nd degree perineal laceration repaired under local anesthesia with 2-0 and 3-0 chromic suture in the usual fashion. EBL 300cc (this is average for SVD).
