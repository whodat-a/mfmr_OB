## Daily flow:
In order of priority (note:  prioritization may be changed based on acuity – if you are unsure of what you should do first, call your attending or the upper level on at that hospital)

## OB Resident coming on:
1. Check out with night team, take notes on OB list, obtain ZipIt.  Write down which attendings are on for both day and night (see list on bulletin board).
2.	Attend group rounds at 7:10 AM, be prepared with:
  -	RSH and No-doc patients in labor – Gestational age, Maternal age, G’s and P’s, pertinent hx (GBS positive? Complications in pregnancy? Expected macrosomy? Past hx c-section?), what time they came in, if they were ruptured or not, if they have an epidural or not, and what the plan is
3.	Round on MFM patients with MFM doc, discuss and clarify plan and orders
  -	Write MFM notes before approx. noon, list MFM doc to cosign
4.	Round on RSH patients (Includes Post C/s mom’s managed by OB if they were ours, no-doc, or MFM’s first) then other pts that you were involved in, if continuing to follow
5.	Riverstone Patient rounding:
  -	Progress notes (see below)
  -	Discharges (see below)
  -	Full newborn exam each time, focused exam on mom
  -	Call or text FMS morning attending for St V to discuss patients after rounding – this should ideally be done before rounds at 10 or 11 am
  -	Circumcisions – arrange with nursing and RSH attending, get consent signed
  -	Visit newborns in NICU, leave social note if not following
6.	At some point, check with West Grand Family Doc on call to see if they have anything planned for the day. If so, remind them and the nurses that you will be involved. If it’s upcoming (i.e. an induction tomorrow or next week), add it to our list so we can be aware and plan to be involved.
7.	Post-partum: We are expected to follow and write notes on the mother and babies  of WGFM: Gerbasi, Cancro
8.	Check labor decks to see if anyone is in labor, ask if you can be involved
  - Ask about procedures scheduled that day—you should go in on every c-section early, even if there is an assist scheduled so that you learn each surgeon’s preferences
  - St V’s MFM (Dr. Wallace, Hodgson)—we are expected to be involved in all of their patients
9.	If you have extra time:
  - St. V’s MFM Outpatient Clinic – It is encouraged to go watch/help with some US’s, walk over to MFM office across skybridge to Yellowstone Building.  They are super nice and it helps develop ultrasound skills!
  - **eCW:**
     - Check for upcoming deliveries; update the OB list with these pts. List of OB pt’s can be found on eCW by going to Report --> OB --> Active pregnancies. Check the box by All Providers and hit update. This info can then be used to update the OB Anticipations document in the OB folder as well as our lists. READ the chart – for ex: NPP’s are not PCP for OB
     - Clean up the active pregnancy tab by looking for pt’s who have transferred care and are at least 2-3 weeks past their due date (or if you happen to know they delivered), send a TE encounter to Mary Hunt to close pregnancy. 
     - Ensure upcoming deliveries have had the appropriate lab work done: GBS, BTL ppwk, etc.  Fax OB summary to L&D in anticipation.
