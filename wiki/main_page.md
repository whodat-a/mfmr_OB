**Miscellaneous Tips:**
Be humble and be nice to the nurses.  Trust their judgement and involve them in patient care.  They can make your life much easier or much harder. Learn from each delivery, even if you are only observing – you can pick up A LOT, and observations count toward numbers too. Log everything you are a part of in New Innovations. Even if OB is not your thing please do not ruin relationships with the OBs that others have worked hard to develop.
