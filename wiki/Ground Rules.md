## Ground Rules: Who we are involved in, when
1. Riverstone patients with our attending and their continuity providers
2. West Grand patients (unless they say “no”) with West Grand doc
3. No-docs with OB attending, both before and after delivery
4. MFM patients with MFM, then OB once they are transferred during/after delivery

Write H&P’s, daily/labor progress notes, and staff with the appropriate attending—if questions, ask the RSH hospital senior or check with the attending in question

Rounds with the laborist, anesthesia, L&D/NICU nursing happen at 7:10 AM/PM.  BE THERE, EVEN IF YOU DON’T HAVE PATIENTS—YOU MAY NEED TO ASSIST ON A C-SECTION, ETC.

Strip review is at noon, 4PM, midnight, and 4AM.  Go to this, you’ll learn stuff!
