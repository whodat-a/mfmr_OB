## OB patient presentation / Sign-out guidelines

### Goal:

Convey pertinent important information between team members and at signout.
Communicate what has been done and what needs to be followed up on/managed. Be concise. People can always ask for more details.

#### EXAMPLE:

 â€œThis is a  **#**yo G**#**P**#** @ **#**wks who presented with SOL/ROL (still in triage) IOL for *xxx/PROM/SROM*.
Her pregnancy has been *uncomplicated/ complicated* by ___________.

Her labor is *progressing*/*not progressing*.

She currently is **#**(dilation), **#**(Station) with Vertex/Breech presentation confirmed by bedside US.
She *does/ does not* have internals (IUPC and FSE) and her contractions *are/are not* adequate.
She *is/is not* on pitocin.
She is GBS *positive/negative/unknown*."

Has the patient been progressing? Comment on this if she is moving fast, if she has not had any descent, if she has been stuck at a certain dilation, etc. **Do not** report blood type or rubella status. This will be something that is easy to find and will not be pertinent to her progress.

Mention details such as blood sugars, blood pressures, estimated fetal weight if she has diabetes, HTN, etc
