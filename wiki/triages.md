## Triages
- Do H&P (see below), examine patient, develop plan. 
- Call attending w/in hr, earlier if emergent 
- Brief summary note also in eCW, under progress notes
- Arrange F/U for pts you discharge 
- Send TE to providers that their pts were seen & with any things to do
- If the patient will be admitted to L&D for likely delivery:
- Admit H&P, documentation, orders
- Notify Attending ASAP
- Call continuity provider and let them know their patient has been admitted
  - if continuity provider is unavailable, may contact another provider that the patient has seen (Look at eCW notes and ASK the patient which provider(s) they want)
  - OB resident manages labor, continuity resident comes in for delivery
  - Attending must be present for any procedures (U/S, AROM, IUPC placement, etc…)  as well as delivery 

## Triage Tips:
### Term triage, r/o labor
 1. Active labor = 4cm, effaced, regular ctx
 2. Observe for at least 2 hours, recheck cervix to r/o change
 3. Follow FHTs

### Preterm Labor = Contractions < 37 weeks + cervical change
1. Follow FHTs on monitor
2. Consider dehydration, infection (consider IVF, GBS, UA, GC/Chl, BV)
3. Consider fetal fibronectin (must do before any other vag exam)
4. Consider TV-US (eval cervical length)
5. If actually in PTL, obtain MFM consult

### R/o ROM
1. Sterile spec exam (minimize SVE unless in labor), check for pooling of fluid, nitrazine, ferning, or fluid expressed from the cervix with valsalva? Collect Wet Mount? 
2. Amnisure

### Vaginal bleeding
1. After 20 wks:  NO SVE if unsure location of placenta – do U/S first
2. Ask about trauma/intercourse
3. Consider urine drug screen

### PROM
1. Monitor for at least 2 hours if at term
2. Consider starting Pitocin (after discussion w/ attending) if candidate for SVD (i.e. reassuring FHTs, no prior uterine scar)

### PPROM – Prior to 36 wks, No contractions
1. Consult MFM
2. Give steroids (Betamethasone) if between 24 and 34 wks
3. Antibiotics
4. Consider tocolysis
5. U/S to determine fluid status

###  Abdominal pain
1. History and physical is key, location, trauma, falls?
2. Contractions, FHT?
3. US early; if indicated - labs
4. Consider non-OB etiology as well (RLQ pain can indicate appendicitis in pregnancy)
5. DDx: abruption, placenta previa, PIH/PEC, pyelonephritis, fatty liver, HELLP, UTI

### Decreased fetal movement
1. FHT monitoring for 1-2 hours
2. Juice/snacks
3. If inadequate movement, need NST/BPP, MFM consult
