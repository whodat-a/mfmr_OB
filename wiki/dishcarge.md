## Discharge Teaching
### Mom

1. Bleeding
2. Anemia: if post partum drop in Hct of > 10 points, will need to start patient on oral iron therapy for 2 months + Vit C
3. Postpartum Depression vs. Baby Blues
4.	Breastfeeding – engorgement will occur by day 3-5 usually, feed often and pump to prevent full, hard breasts, if they are breastfeeding encourage healthy diet
5.	Contraception
6.	PE/DVT risk, signs/symptoms
7.	Meds:  pain control – NSAIDs preferable; stool softener especially if using opiates and iron, PNV +/- iron (encourage for 3 mo PP, especially if breastfeeding)
